# Arch Linux Docker CI Image
This container derives from
[vcatechnology/archlinux](https://hub.docker.com/r/vcatechnology/arch) so that the
image has the latest [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/) packages. It then
installs the some useful development packages.

## Packages
  - [`bash-bats`](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/bash-bats/)
  - [`openssh`](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/openssh/)
