This container derives from
[vcatechnology/arch](https://hub.docker.com/r/vcatechnology/arch) so that the
image has the latest [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/) packages. It then
installs the **B**ash **A**utomated **T**esting **S**ystem.

Available on Docker Hub as [vcatechnology/arch-bats](https://hub.docker.com/r/vcatechnology/arch-bats/)
